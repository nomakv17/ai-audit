# AI Consulting Landing Page – Project Blueprint

## 1. Project Vision
- **Goal**: Turn referrals and personal contacts into free AI audit clients so I can build real case studies.
- **Tone**: Simple, clear, friendly, and professional.
- **Audience**: General business owners, busy teams, and managers (not just tech people).

## 2. Core Offer (Hero Text)
I've spent the last year testing a lot of AI tools. Now I help businesses figure out which tools are actually worth using, and where they can save time every week.

This month, I'm offering 3 free AI audits for business owners in exchange for honest feedback and a short testimonial.

## 3. How It Works (4-Step Process)
A simple 4-step process to get you started:

1. **Discovery** – A 15-minute chat to tell you what the audit is all about and see if it's a fit.
2. **Deep Dive** – I look into your specific business workflows and processes to learn exactly where the bottlenecks are.
3. **The Audit** – I identify the top 3 AI tools to save your team 10+ hours a week.
4. **The Roadmap** – You get a simple PDF plan to implement them.

## 4. Services

Use a clean 3-column layout or table for these:

- **AI Business Audit**
  - *What it does*: A review of how you work today and where AI can help.
  - *Value in simple words*: Helps you and your team save time every week, not just cut costs.

- **AI Voice Call Solutions**
  - *What it does*: A human-like AI that can answer calls, chat with callers, book appointments, and take messages.
  - *Value in simple words*: You stop missing calls, and customers still feel like they're talking to a real person.

- **Automations**
  - *What it does*: Connects your tools so info moves automatically (for example between forms, email, sheets, CRMs, calendars).
  - *Value in simple words*: Less copy-and-paste, fewer mistakes, and more time for real work.

## 5. Who This Is For

Short bullet list:

- General businesses that want their day-to-day work to feel lighter.
- Business owners who are curious about AI but don't want to waste time learning every tool.
- Busy teams dealing with calls, emails, or admin work.
- Managers, admins, or anyone who deals with the same tasks over and over.

## 6. Personal Section (with Photo)

Design a section near the top that shows my professional photo on one side and this text on the other:

Hi, I'm Tai Alabi.
I build AI tools, voice callers, and automations for real businesses.
Right now I'm putting together case studies, so the audit is free in exchange for honest feedback.

Add a clear placeholder for a circular professional photo (for example: a rounded image on the right side of the hero on desktop, stacked on mobile).

## 7. Authority & Social Proof

Do NOT say "I've helped 80,000 people."
Instead, simply show the numbers so people can judge the authority themselves.

Use a small stats row or icons, something like:

- **Instagram**: 80k+ followers at @aihustle.alabi
- **LinkedIn**: Active profile at /in/taialabi

These should be visually noticeable but not braggy.

## 8. Contact & CTA

Main call-to-action:

- Button text: **Let's Find Your 10 Hours**
- Action: Link to email or booking (for now, use `mailto:abdul@spacevoice.ai`)

Contact / links section:

- **Email**: abdul@spacevoice.ai
- **LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/taialabi
- **Instagram**: https://www.instagram.com/aihustle.alabi/

## 9. Share With a Friend

Add a small section near the bottom:

Not sure it's for you?
You can still share this page with a friend who might want a free AI audit.

Include a simple "Copy link" style button or clear text instruction.

---

Follow this plan exactly when generating the UI. Keep the copy as close as possible to this text and avoid adding technical jargon or extra marketing buzzwords.
